        Mixed Media Artist
        </p>

<p id="description2">Soovin Choi explores various art mediums that are made from the 19th century to 21st century
such as Cyanotypes,Van Dyke prints, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, and Touch Designer.
Alternative process photography and digital media arts have two centuries' difference.
Thus, She likes to call herself a time traveler artist because she jump around the centuries to create artworks.
<br>
<br>Soovin Choi, an international student from South Korea to study arts. Came to the States to study film at first, then she fell in love with film photography while she was studying at Monterey Peninsula College. After she studied black and white photography for 2 years, Choi transferred to San Jose State University for a photography program. However, she found her big interest in Digital Media Arts from taking the ART74 class:introduction to Digital Media Arts. The infinite possibility of creating unique mix media artwork was the interesting factor of her changing major to Digital Media Arts. Because Choi has been exploring various art fields, she would like to utilize her digital media artwork with her photography and film experiences and techniques.
<br><br>
From experiencing some photography projects and exhibitions, she has established solid artistic intention in her work. Since Choi is an international student, who is living life as an alien, she ask herself a lot about her presence, and that anxiety gives her a good motivation for work. She feel more close and creative to her works and projects when it is related to her life. Therefore, most topics Choi work on are identity, cultures, Korea, stereotypes and discrimination.
<br><br>
Soovin Choi is developing mix media works that are made of various mediums. For example, she made a hand object with wires, then did video projection mapping on it (Video Art-”Welcoming”). Her most interest is making interactive art. Still learning audio visualization with Max, but she will learn more, and would like to make an artwork that the audience can actively interact with. Moreover, since Choi enjoys the analog and digital platform at the same time, she’d like to explore combining these two elements: analog and digital.
<br><br>
Everyday and every moment in the United States for the past five years have inspired, provoked Soovin Choi's curiosity and passion and helped seek her voice as an artist. During this journey, creating art is a special shelter where she can breathe. In future, she wants to be an art professor who provides a safe shelter to students where they can freely express themselves and find their abilities.</p>

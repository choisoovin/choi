       <h1>"Your Parking Lot," 2021</h1>
       <p>Medium: Maya, 3840 x 2160</p>
       <p>Description:</p>
    <p>   Here is your FREE parking lot with joy! I liked to create an installation space where I could bring the audience’s happy, fun but aesthetic experience from twisting the usual space in the virtual space. Thus, I made a vivid virtual space of a parking lot romantically visualized with decorating of carpet, mirrorball, ocean wave, and free parking lot sign—transforming the daily visited place into the art space with the juxtaposition of realistic, unrealistic characteristics.</p>

       <h1>"Warm Rescue," 2021</h1>
       <p>Medium: Maya, 1920 x 1080px</p>
       <p>Description:</p>
    <p>   I feel lonely as an international student who does not have any family to rely on not only the whole time in the United States but also during Covid-19. I greatly missed a noisy dinner with someone. Indeed, humanism, affection, and compassion were needed.
    There was news that the dog saved a blacked-out person by laying next to her, sharing warmth with her for two days. What if there is a prosthetic for human beings who need another human being to hold their hands and tell them that everything is okay? I wanted to bring that news and personal experience to my prosthetic project, Warm Rescue. A person can wear the bracelet, and Warm Rescue will get to you whenever you touch the bracelet: 365 days & 36.5°C support.
    <br><br>Since I desired a “warm” atmosphere with other human beings, I brought the human temperature, 36.5°C, to the prosthetic object to express support. Then, I scanned my hand gesture, trying to make a person stand and made it a giant hand to show its big support and precious existence. Moreover, I wanted this prosthetic object to be shown as a lifeguard, so I scanned a laying person reaching out for Warm Rescue for the dramatic scene. Furthermore, Warm Rescue offers a flowery environment and sweet cake with coffee because these are everyday lifesavers to most people. To sum up, it is a warm, soothing package for a person who called Warm Rescue for help. <br><br>
    The obstacle I had was not getting a clean body scan due to not having a face-id cell phone; then, I got a Kinect from eBay and finally got it scanned after many trials. Getting hand scanned was challenging, yet, I wore a dishwashing rubber glove and got it scanned. Thus, it came out with more movement features and vitality.
